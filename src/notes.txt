***Difficulties faced****

if the diece value was greater than the remaining path it was getting error , so resolved it by using the loop
while using link for css we need to use a example 
.logo a{
  margin: 0;
  color: #1BA098;
  text-decoration: none;
}

instead of 
.logo {
  margin: 0;
  color: #1BA098;
  text-decoration: none;
}
